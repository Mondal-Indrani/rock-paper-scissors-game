Rock Paper Scissors Game (Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript):  

Rock Paper Scissor* is a classic hand game where two players choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the winner is determined based on simple rules:  
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper 
- Paper beats Rock  
- If both choose the same, it's a draw  
Implementation:
1. HTML: 
   - Defines the structure with a heading, images for choices, a scoreboard, and a message display.  
   - A reset button is included to restart the game.  

2. CSS: 
   - Styles the game with a modern UI, hover effects, and a responsive layout.  
   - The score, message box, and choices have distinct styles for a better user experience.  

3. JavaScript:  
   - Uses `querySelector` to select game elements.  
   - Listens for clicks on Rock, Paper, or Scissors and generates a random computer choice.  
   - Implements the game logic to compare choices and update scores dynamically.  
   - A reset button function clears scores and starts the game fresh.  

This interactive game is a great way to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic in JavaScript.
